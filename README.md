Identifying interpretable potential confounders from clinical text

This repository presents a simple pipeline that can be used to uncover potential interpretable confounders from clinical text. 

Due to IRB restrictions, we cannot share the data needed to demonstrate the code. We share the R analysis pipeline post data-processing as an example of how to implement our method. The existing code is developed on R version 4.0.2.
